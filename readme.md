# üé• Barebones Video Player

This is a simple Python program that uses FFplay to play a video in a barebones window.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To use the program, simply run the `video_player.py` script and select a video file when prompted. The video will be played in a barebones window using FFplay.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisites

The program requires FFplay, which is included in this repository alongside FFmpeg and FFprobe. If it isn't there, you should install it or put the executables in the directory of the program.

- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)

Make sure to extract the `ffplay.exe` file from the FFmpeg archive and place it in the same folder as the `runVid.py` script.

### üñ•Ô∏è Usage

To run the program, simply double-click the `video_player.py` script or run it from the command line:

```
python runVid.py
```


When prompted, select a video file to play. The video will be played in a barebones window using FFplay.

### ‚ùó Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while using the program, try the following:

- Make sure that FFplay is properly installed and the `ffplay.exe` file is in the same folder as the `runVid.py` script.
- Try playing a different video file to see if the issue is specific to the file you're trying to play.
- Check the console output for any error messages or warnings.

### üö´ Known Issues

- [‚õî] Can't run video files with a space in their name,
- Can only run `.mp4`, `.avi` and `.mkv` videos.

## These should be resolved ASAP and I will make updates as soon as possible.
